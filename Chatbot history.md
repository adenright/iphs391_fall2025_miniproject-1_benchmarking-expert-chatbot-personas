I'm intermediate. I keep falling out of my turns

* Ensure your preparation is strong: engage your core and find your balance before initiating the turn.  
* Focus on spotting: keep your head aligned and your gaze fixed on a point to maintain control.  
* Check your plié: a deep plié will give you the necessary power for a clean take-off.  
* Maintain consistent épaulement: your shoulders should remain aligned with your hips throughout the turn to prevent losing balance.  
* Control your landing: land softly on the supporting leg with a strong core to stabilize your position.

Falling out of turns often indicates a lack of control; refine these elements to improve stability.

How can I get my arabesque higher?

To achieve a higher arabesque, focus on the following technical aspects:

1. Hip Alignment: Ensure your hips are square and level. Avoid letting the supporting hip drop; this will help maintain balance and allow for a higher extension.  
2. Core Engagement: Strengthen your core muscles to provide stability. A strong core will support your back and help lift the leg higher without compromising your alignment.  
3. Leg Extension: Work on your hamstring and glute strength. Incorporate exercises like leg lifts and glute bridges to build the necessary strength for a higher arabesque.  
4. Foot Position: Point your toes and engage the entire leg. A well-extended foot will create a longer line and visually enhance the height of your arabesque.  
5. Upper Body Position: Maintain a lifted upper body with your shoulders down and back. Your épaulement should be open and expressive, which can help with the overall aesthetic of the arabesque.

Practice these elements consistently to see improvement in your arabesque height. Remember, progress takes time and dedication.

I keep falling out of my turns, what are some tips for a clean fourth position outside pirouette?

To achieve a clean fourth position outside pirouette and prevent falling out of your turns, focus on the following:

1. Preparation: Begin with a strong plié in fourth position. Ensure your weight is evenly distributed and your core is engaged. This foundational strength is crucial for a stable turn.  
2. Spotting: Establish a clear spotting technique. Fix your gaze on a specific point and maintain it until you complete the turn. This will help with balance and control.  
3. Arm Placement: Position your arms correctly. They should be rounded and held at a low second or in front of you, depending on your preference. Ensure they are not too far from your body, as this can disrupt balance.  
4. Turnout from the Hips: Maintain your turnout from the hips throughout the turn. Avoid forcing turnout from the knees, as this can lead to instability and potential injury.  
5. Controlled Landing: Focus on a soft and controlled landing. As you finish the turn, land in a strong fourth position with your weight centered over your supporting leg. Engage your core to stabilize your position.

Incorporate these tips into your practice to enhance your control and precision in fourth position outside pirouettes. Consistency and attention to detail are key.
