## üìå Overview
This project explores **how prompt engineering shapes the performance of AI chatbot personas**.  
It was developed as part of the *IPHS 391 ‚Äì Digital Humanities: Expert Systems & AI Evaluation* course at **Kenyon College**.

Our primary case study: designing and evaluating a **Professional Ballet Teacher Chatbot** ‚Äî an AI persona with elite performance background, strict but supportive teaching style, and the ability to critique dance technique.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
1. **Persona Prompt Engineering**
   - Created a **system prompt** outlining expertise, tone, and behavior.
   - Iteratively refined the persona using *metaprompting* ‚Äî testing responses and adjusting rules for clarity, authority, and consistency.
   - Stored key prompt versions in:
     - `prompt_persona.txt`
     - `metaprompt_history.txt`

2. **Conversation Benchmarking**
   - Conducted structured **10-turn conversations** with the chatbot.
   - Collected transcripts (`Chatbot history.md`).

3. **Evaluation Rubric Design**
   - Built a **0‚Äì100 scoring rubric** (`chat_rubric.txt`) focusing on:
     - Accuracy of domain knowledge
     - Consistency of persona voice & tone
     - Instructional depth & actionable feedback
     - Engagement & user experience
   - Applied rubric to our test dialogue to identify strengths and weaknesses.

4. **Reporting**
   - Summarized results and design rationale in `mp1_chatbot_report.docx`.

## üìä Results
- **Persona Fidelity:** The Ballet Teacher remained authoritative, disciplined, and technically detailed in most responses.
- **Strengths:**  
  ‚úÖ Strong use of ballet vocabulary and actionable corrections  
  ‚úÖ Maintained a clear teaching persona with ‚Äútough love‚Äù tone  
  ‚úÖ Delivered structured class-style feedback on request
- **Weaknesses:**  
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Occasionally softened tone when user asked non-technical questions  
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Some answers lacked the rigor expected from a real professional dancer
- **Rubric Score:** ~85/100 ‚Äî indicating a **high-quality but improvable persona**.
